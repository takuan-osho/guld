Guld
====

This is a hobby program whose aim is to learn Git internal and how to write it in Go.

### Caution:

It is immature and doesn't implement basic git commands yet.

If you search for git implementation written in Go, it is good to watch other projects as follows:

-	[gogit](https://github.com/speedata/gogit)
